# Introduction to Resume App
A great way to get a professional looking resume is with the help of Resume App. With this app you can create a professional looking CV for free. Once you have created it you will be able to save it as PDF file. You can also share the CV with other apps.

## Objective of Resume App
A resume objective is an eye-catching statement of your career intent that's placed on top of your resume. The resume objective provides a 2-3 sentence snapshot of your professional experience, skills, and achievements, and explains why they make you the right candidate for the job.

## Contents screen controller widget
The code appears to be written in the Dart programming language and uses the Flutter framework. It defines a stateless widget that returns a Scaffold widget, which is the basic material design visual layout structure. The Scaffold widget consists of multiple child widgets like the SingleChildScrollView, Column, and multiple instances of the CardWidget.

From a functional perspective, the code seems to be creating a UI for a resume application. The UI contains the following elements:

- A container widget with the "Resume" text.
- A row with two CardWidgets for displaying the Objective and Experience sections.
- A row with one CardWidget for displaying the Skills section.
- A row with one CardWidget for displaying the Achievements section.
- A row with two CardWidgets for displaying the Expertise and Qualification sections.
- A row with two CardWidgets for displaying the Hobbies and References sections.
- Each CardWidget contains an image, a title, and an on-tap function that opens a dialog box with the corresponding section's details.

In summary, the functional requirements of this code are to create a UI for a resume application that displays the user's objective, experience, skills, achievements, expertise, qualifications, hobbies, and references. The UI should be visually appealing, and each section should have a corresponding CardWidget that opens a dialog box with the section's details when tapped.
